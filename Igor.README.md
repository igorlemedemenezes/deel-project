# Notes

I found the test very interesting and how it was put together, congratulations.

The solution I created was based on a code structure where I am defining all the business rules within a file called service, all communications such as the bank are within the repository and calls to endpoints are within resources.

Below the tests folder are the tests that I created based on what was passed to solve the problem.

Hope you like it.
